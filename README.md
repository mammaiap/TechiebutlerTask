# TechiebutlerTask

Dear Reviewer,
i am using MVVM architecure and following SOLID principles and Clean architecure and Modular design in mind.
i have separated business Logic, UI and Network like separate modules. so that we can cover it in unit tests.i have
compose the modules in the composition root.and wrote the unit tests.


Key features Implemented:
• Data fetching and Rendering
• Pagination
• Heavy Computation & Optimization (Log the API fetch elapsed time)
• Callback Memoization


How to run the app:
• to run the app in iOS Simulator :

->> launch the TechiebutlerTask.xcodeproj in xcode
->> select the prefered iOS Simulator 
->> run the build,
->> once the build succeded, it will launch the app in the simulator.

• to run the app in iOS Devices :
